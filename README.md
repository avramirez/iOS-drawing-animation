iOS-drawing-animation
=====================

Different ways to have a drawing animation effect in iOS.


- iOS CAShapeLayer and CAAnimation
- Video - MediaPlayer.framework
- HTML5/JQuery animation - UIWebView


### iOS CAShapeLayer and CAAnimation

Animating the property of CAShapeLayer strokeEnd 

### Video - MPMoviePlayerController

This process uses a video file to render the handwritting animation, I used flash to make the animation
then export it to a .mov video.

Then using MediaPlayer.framework to present the video in full screen without any playback controls.
